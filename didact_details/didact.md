# Didact - teaching cluster

didact is a small cluster dedicated to teaching classes. There will be no maintenances during the semesters and all upgrades and updates will be done 
depending on academic schedule so as not to interfere with classes. didact consists of 8 machines with 16 cores each. It has a separate filesystem from 
the general Amarel cluster. (See also https://ask.oarc.rutgers.edu/question/35/what-are-the-differences-between-didact-and-amarel/)

## How to connect to didact? 

To connect to didact, just open your browser and this link: https://didact.oarc.rutgers.edu (you must be connected to VPN, otherwise it will show up as "Page not found"). 
Use your netid and password to login (note: you must have an Amarel account. If you are part of a class teaching on didact, this will be provided to you.)
OARC does not administer netids and passwords - we get the authentication from the central authentication service at Rutgers.
